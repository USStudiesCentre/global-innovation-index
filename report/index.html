    <center><h1 style="font-size:20px; color:black">Australia’s world ranking in innovation is falling. </h1> </center><br>

Ranked as high as the 17th most innovative country in the world by the Global Innovation Index (GII) in 2015, Australia fell the year after to 19th, and in 2017, it comes in at 23rd – overtaken by China and behind New Zealand. <br><br>

Meanwhile, the US ranking in the GII’s assessment of innovative performance keeps improving. Currently ranked behind Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands as the fourth most innovative country in the world, the United States has never ranked lower than 11th since the GII began in 2007 and has either maintained or improved its ranking since 2010.

        <h3 style="color:black">
        Why is innovation relevant in a country like Australia, which has enjoyed an unprecedented quarter century of uninterrupted economic growth?</h3>

       Ultimately, innovation will determine Australia’s future. Innovation drives business competitiveness, new business growth, new jobs and is a key driver of economic growth. <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oslo-manual_9789264013100-en">Defined by the OECD</a> as “the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), process, new marketing method or a new organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations,” the OECD <a href="http://www.oecd.org/publications/the-innovation-imperative-9789264239814-en.htm">attributes</a> approximately 50 percent of member countries long term economic growth to innovation. Innovative economies are better able to support higher living standards and therefore innovation plays a key role in national prosperity. <br><br>
Benefiting from over a quarter century of continued economic growth following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s and a mining boom through much of the 2000s and 2010s, Australia now enjoys high wage standards and standards of living as well as a strong social safety net. In order to maintain its productivity and lifestyle, however, Australia has no choice but to embrace innovation.<br> <br>

The importance of innovation is not lost on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who embraced innovation as a major early agenda item. In December 2015, less than three months after Turnbull became Prime Minister, the Australian government released its National Innovation and Science Agenda. Focusing on growing the innovation climate through improvements in capital, collaboration, talent and skills and the role government plays as an exemplar, the Prime Minister said this innovation agenda would “help create the modern, dynamic 21st century economy Australia needs”.
<h3 style="color:black">
Why then, just under two years after announcing this ambitious innovation agenda, has Australia’s world ranking on the GII fallen? Why is the United States improving its innovation ranking while Australia’s keeps falling? </h3>

While one could argue that the United States has simply been “doing” innovation for longer than Australia, a deeper dive into the data shows that the United States has certain characteristics that make it fundamentally better positioned for innovative growth. That is not to say that Australia lacks the ability to be more innovative. Analysing the 81 indicators of the GII help give a better explanation on these issues.<br><br>
Another question may be why it is relevant to compare the United States to Australia when the United States has an economy 15 times larger and a population 13 times larger. The United States may be ranked as the fourth most innovative country in the world, but it remains the number one destination for much of the output of Australia’s innovation – and much of the world’s, for that matter. The obituary for the loss of America’s innovative supremacy has been written many times but this GII data, along with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/new-cfr-book-how-american-innovation-can-overcome-asian-challenge">other research</a>, make it clear such sentiment is still premature. Though many have proclaimed this to be the Asian Century, the United States still attracts the best and brightest minds for innovation, particularly from Australia.<br> <br>

Furthermore, as a close ally in economic, military, intelligence, and diplomatic spheres, it makes sense to analyse the differences in order to see what Australia does well compared to the United States and what Australia could perhaps learn from the United States. <br><br>

An opportunity exists for Australia to learn from the US leadership in innovation. Examining how we differ on the factors making up the GII is a good starting point. <br><br>
Produced jointly by Cornell University, INSEAD business school and the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the Global Innovation Index assesses the innovation performance of 127 countries and economies around the world based on 81 indicators. It is the most authoritative and comprehensive resource for quantifying innovation amongst nations. It also clearly articulates what Australia does well and what Australia could do better in when it comes to innovation. <br><br>

There has been a prolonged debate in Australia and elsewhere about how accurate the GII is. How exactly, <a href="http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/why-smashed-avocado-is-innovation-that-counts-20170919-gykbq4">some have asked</a>, can one quantify the impact of Australia’s popularization of avocado on toast? Cafes around the world have now adopted the healthy Australian snack, which innovated a new way to use an avocado, but how is that innovation quantified in the GII measurements? The simplest answer is that avocado on toast is not quantified in the GII. But at the same time, however, neither is Japanese sushi or Korean Bibimbap or Scotland’s deep fried Mars bars. Ultimately, more comprehensive innovation measures should be sought after but even then, it would be unlikely that improved measures would show that Australia innovates more than the other countries ranked higher than it on the GII. <br><br>

Measuring innovation is a difficult and imprecise process. The GII is by no means the only measure of innovation available. Other organisations, particularly the OECD and World Economic Forum, also analyse innovation using various data. Yet it is the GII which has the most indicators covering the widest breadth. <br><br>

<h2 id="GIIexplanation">How the GII works</h2>
The overall ranking of each country in the GII is essentially done by averaging the scores of each country based on 81 indicators – with most scores ranging from 0 to 100. In 2017, the top composite score of 67.69 belongs to Switzerland, while the US score is 60.89 and the Australian score is 51.83. <br><br>

<a href="https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/about-gii#framework">More specifically</a>, the 81 indicators are all located within either an innovation input sub-index score, which tries to capture the elements that enable innovative activities, and an innovation output sub-index score, which tries to capture the results of innovative activities. Within each of these sub-indices are multiple pillars. There are five pillars within the innovation input sub-index: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. There are two pillars within the innovation output sub-index: creative outputs and knowledge and technology outputs. Each pillar is divided into three sub-pillars and then each sub-pillar is comprised of a varying number of indicators.
<br><br>
It should be noted that the indicators and number of countries included can vary from year to year.

<div id="writing">

<h2>What do these indicators say about innovation in Australia?</h2>
Perhaps we can start with what was already known about the issue at hand. Given the importance of innovation to Australia’s future, extensive research has shown time and again three major areas where Australia lacks in terms of building a more innovative climate, especially when compared to the United States: capital, networks, and culture. <br><br>

<b>Capital</b> – As a resource rich, capital poor country, Australia has always been reliant on foreign injections of funds. If an Australia technology company is trying to rapidly grow, the main source of capital will likely be the United States. It comes as no surprise, then, that thousands of Australians choose to live in major centres for venture capital, like Silicon Valley, instead of remaining in Australia. If an Australian innovator is ambitious, Australia will likely eventually not have the capital resources to facilitate their growth.<br><br>

<b>Networks </b>– Related to capital, networks and “repeat founders” are critical for building capacity for innovation. Given the comparably less availability of capital and support networks for experienced professionals doing innovative work, many of the most successful firms simply do not stay around in Australia long enough to be impactful over the long term. Instead, many choose to go to Silicon Valley or elsewhere – a brain drain of sorts. Ultimately this erodes Australia’s network for innovation.
<br><br>
<b>Culture</b> – The Turnbull government should be lauded for its initial embrace of innovation but the fact that the government would barely mention the term just over a year into office is indicative of the political ramifications for embracing the relatively novel concept to Australia. While Australia has long been known for its rugged ingenuity developed in its island isolation, it lacks the ambitious and risk-embracing nature that is evident in more innovative nations. Whether it be the result of Tall Poppy Syndrome or simply a humbler outlook on life, Australians needs to learn to embrace risk and rid themselves of the limiting fear of failure.<br><br>

Australia remains an inefficient innovator – It has been clear since the first GII was released in 2007 that Australia is an inefficient innovator, today ranking 76th out of 127 countries in innovation efficiency. Essentially, Australia is putting considerable effort into trying to be innovative, but it has yet to see the results that match the effort.<br><br>

Australia’s innovation inputs are indeed impressive, ranking 12th in the world when combining its scores across the five pillars of institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication and business sophistication. It’s Australia’s outputs that lag considerably, ranking 30th in the world and behind nations like Malta and Cyprus.


<h2 id="auexcel">Australian strengths compared to the United States</h2>
Australia enjoys a number of remarkable strengths that make it ripe for becoming an innovative powerhouse. Of the seven pillars making up the GII, Australia is in the top 15 in the world in institutions (14th), human capital and research (9th), infrastructure (7th), and market sophistication (9th). Outside of market sophistication, Australia actually scores better on these pillars than the United States, with eight indicators where Australia is significantly ahead of the United States in the GII.<br><br>

<b>Education </b>- The biggest positive difference in the data placing Australia ahead of the United States is in education. Australia excels in many indicators within education, ranking first in the world in the number of years that students spend in school (“2.1.3 School life expectancy, years”), averaging over 20 years. The average American, on the other hand, spends an average of 17 years in school. Given the cost of tertiary education in the United States compared to Australia, this result is not surprising.<br><br>

When comparing US and Australian student reading, scientific, and mathematical proficiency on a state level (“2.1.4 PISA scales in reading, maths, & science”), the results are all the more striking. Massachusetts, the US state with the highest average exam scores in terms of proficiency in reading, science and mathematics proficiency, is still lower than all Australian states and territories, except Tasmania.<br><br>

Australia also ranks sixth in the world in percentage of foreign students that make up its university system (“2.2.3 Tertiary-level inbound mobility”) while the United States ranks 40th. Australia’s remarkably high level of foreign university students, most of whom are from China, has been a financial boon to universities across the country.<br><br>

<b>Infrastructure & governance </b>– As innovative as the United States is, the government has not had much of an explicit innovation policy. A number of innovations – from the internet to bar codes to freeze drying technology – have been developed either by or with the aid of US government agencies and institutions, but the US government has by and large not successfully implemented any meaningful innovation policy. This lack of policy is evident in its own processes: despite the fact that a US government agency helped create the modern internet, the US government itself is ranked ninth and twelfth in the world in government online services and technology-supported participation in government processes.<br><br>

The Australian government, on the other hand, is ranked second in the world both in government online services and technology-supported participation in government processes. Furthermore, Australia’s infrastructure pillar is ranked 7th while the US infrastructure is ranked 21st. The Australia government has not only taken it upon itself to implement an innovation policy with wide ranging implications for the broader society, but it has also, in many areas, become the gold standard of online accessibility and innovation infrastructure.<br><br>

<h2 id="usexcel">Where the United States excels compared to Australia</h2>
While Australia has shown that it excels in the innovation input, the United States has proven to be world-class in its innovation output. Despite the US having lower ranks on infrastructure, human capital and research and institutions, it is more efficient in its innovation because it does more with less. Essentially, the U.S. does not have as strong an innovation framework as other nations – outside of market sophistication, where it ranks first – yet it continues to produce leading innovation nonetheless.<br><br>

With more than 25 factors where the US is significantly ahead of Australia, Australia has considerable room for growth. In three pillars in particular – namely business sophistication, knowledge and technology outputs, and creative outputs – Australia ranks moderately to significantly below the United States. Within these three pillars, the specific sub-pillars where Australia ranks significantly below the United States are innovation linkages; knowledge absorption; trade, competition, & market scale; investment; knowledge creation; knowledge impact; knowledge diffusion; creative goods & services; and online creativity.<br><br>

By far the starkest contrast between the United States and Australia in all these sub-pillars is within knowledge diffusion, where the United States ranks 12th while Australia ranks 96th. The GII’s knowledge diffusion sub-pillar is made up of four indicators: Intellectual property receipts as a percent of total trade, high tech exports as a percent of total trade, ICT services as a percent of total trade, and FDI net outflows as a percent of total GDP.
<br><br>
<b>Patent applications </b>– The United States ranks sixth in the GII for resident patent applications (“6.1.1 Patent applications by origin”) filed at a national patent office while Australia ranks 45th.<br><br>

This can largely be attributed to the fact that only six percent of Australian patents were held by Australians in 2016. The top three destinations of patents filed by Australians were the US (43 percent) and the European Patent Office (43 percent). Cost is a huge factor in the small number of Australian patents. According to Paula Chavez, an American patent lawyer now working in Australia, a US patent application costs around $2,000-$3,000, while the cost will be upwards of $10,000 in Australia. It’s no surprise then that only 1,433 patents were granted by IP Australia for Australian residents in 2016, but almost 6 times that were filed abroad.<br><br>

<b>Venture capital deals</b> – The United States ranks first in the number of venture capital deals per billion PPP$ GDP while Australia ranks 22nd.<br><br>

In 2016, Australia’s venture capital amounted to only 0.023 percent of its GDP, less than half the OECD average of 0.049 percent. Compared to the US, there is 7.3 times more US venture funding than in Australia on a per capita basis. In 2016, 21 US venture capital funds were raised that were individually larger than the whole amount raised in the Australian market in that year. Due to the limited availability of funds, many Australians seek capital abroad, especially in the US, as it is much easier to raise money where there is more money to be distributed. In fact, in 2016, one in five start-ups were looking to undertake capital raising overseas. At the same time, venture capital fundraising in Australia reached the highest level on record in FY2016, with seven funds raising a total of $568 million. Australian VC investment hit $230m in the second quarter of 2017, with the number of deals increasing from 25 to 36. <br><br>

<b>Research talent in business</b> – The United States ranks fourth in the world in researchers in business (“Research talent in business enterprise”), while Australia, ranked 46th in the GII, has the lowest rate of collaboration on innovation between industry and researchers in the OECD.<br><br>

The government threatens the advancement of research in Australia with its replacement of the 457-visa, making it more difficult for foreign researchers to work in Australia. The changes include the requirement of two years working experience, which <a href="http://www.afr.com/leadership/457-visa-changes-may-stop-universities-hiring-super-talents-20170419-gvns0i">will prevent new PhD graduates from overseas to contribute to Australian research</a>. This will further affect university lecturers, who made up nearly 2000 of the 457 visas, as they are now in the category for the short-term, two-year visa.<br><br>

<b>Business expenditures on R&D </b>– While much of the data in the GII is country-focused, some of the data is available at a state level in both the United States and Australia. This enables a comparison of US and Australian states. One remarkable comparison is business expenditures on research and development (BERD) as a percent of gross state product. Though Australia is ranked 16th on this indicator and only trails the United States at 10th place by a small margin, a closer look at state level data shows a greater discrepancy. New South Wales, the Australian state that spends more on R&D than any other, both in sheer size and as a percentage of gross state product, is ranked 26th overall when combining US and Australian states into a comparison list. As a percentage of gross state product, New South Wales spends less on research and development than the US states of Idaho, Kansas, and New Hampshire. <br><br>

<h2 id="outliers">Outliers</h2>
While any standard comparison of nations will be the subject of debate, some measurements are more controversial than others. One such controversial indicator in the GII is the cost of redundancy dismissal, which measures the “notice period and severance pay for redundancy dismissal (in salary weeks, averages for workers with 1, 5, and 10 years of tenure, with a minimum threshold of 8 weeks)”. <br><br>

Australia ranks 43rd overall in this category while the United States is tied for first along with 19 other nations. While in most indicators, countries would like to be ranked first, this is one instance where Australia may prefer to have a lower rank. Ultimately, less notice and mandatory severance pay can instigate a social instability that some nations would prefer avoiding.<br><br>

<h2>Areas for future research</h2>
<b>Clusters</b> – While the GII focuses on innovation on a nation-wide level, there is growing consensus amongst innovation researchers that innovative activity is often concentrated in geographic clusters – such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Boston. Until the 2017 iteration of the GII, however, the innovative nature of these clusters was never quantified. <br><br>
The GII’s first attempt at ranking them is done purely by number of Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) filings. Tokyo-Yokohama and Shenzhen-Hong Kong are, respectively, ranked first and second with San Jose-San Francisco ranked third. The only Australian regions within the 100 listed clusters are Sydney, which ranks 44th in the world, and Melbourne, which ranks 60th.<br><br>

<b>Ability to attract skilled migrants </b>– Innovative firms around the world are all in competition with each other to attract the best and brightest, particularly the best and brightest among those with STEM skills. Australia has benefited enormously from its family-friendly lifestyle – attracting and keeping skilled individuals who have gone on to make innovative contributions impacting the world. While stability, exam scores and safety are all important indicators, they do not reflect livability – a key attraction for innovators in Australia. Australian cities are some of the most livable in the world, with Melbourne consistently ranking as the worlds most livable city according to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Livability Index, which ranks 140 cities each year. Adelaide and Perth also rank in the top 10 with top scores on healthcare, education and infrastructure. Sydney is 11th and all five major state capitals rank in the top 20.  A quantifiable livability indicator would enrich the GII. 

<h2 id="policyrecs">Policy recommendations</h2>
<b>Incentivize venture capital</b> – Australia is famously resource rich and capital poor. While innovative ideas come out of Australia, the lack of domestic capital restricts the ability to grow such ideas into major businesses. Many of Australia’s best and brightest companies and entrepreneurs end up moving to Silicon Valley, where the capital and networks they need to grow their firms is available. If Australian governments want ambitious firms to not only be created in Australia but to stay and grow in Australia too, they will need to incentivize venture capital firms (VCs), most of whom will be from the US, to establish offices in Australia. <br><br>

Government incentives for VCs is obviously not an easy policy to implement in an increasingly populist political climate. Yet one need only to look at Israel to see how effective such policies can be. Once lacking in VCs, the Israeli government in 1993 established the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/israel/2491258.pdf">Yozma program</a>, which provided equity guarantees and tax breaks primarily for US VCs. Today, the program’s incentives have largely been phased out but Israel, now known as the “start-up nation”, has a <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/industry-and-services/entrepreneurship-at-a-glance-2016/venture-capital-investments-as-a-percentage-of-gdp_entrepreneur_aag-2016-graph119-en#page1">higher rate of venture capital</a> as a share of GDP than any other OECD country.<br><br>

<b>Welcome skilled immigrants</b> – One of the primary reasons the United States has been able to maintain its innovative edge for so long is the fact that it has, for the most part, maintained an immigration system that has welcomed the likes of Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX, Segei Brin of Google, and Andy Grove of Intel. More than <a href="http://www.newamericaneconomy.org/an-open-letter-from-1470-economists-on-immigration/">1,400 economists</a> agreed that immigrants in the United States are significantly more likely to work in innovative STEM fields that “create life-improving products and drive economic growth.”<br><br>

Australia has taken steps recently to limit skills-based business visas. Known throughout the world for its exceptional lifestyle, Australia can more easily attract highly skilled migrants than almost any other country in the region. However, Australia should look to Canada’s Global Skills Strategy, which has the purpose of making it easier for Canadian businesses to attract the talent they need to succeed in the global marketplace. Canada is welcoming global talent, particularly in global talent occupations recognized as being in short supply, recognizing in doing so Canadian firms can scale-up and grow, creating additional jobs. High-skilled work permits can be processed in two-weeks. 
<br><br>
<b>Welcome anchor firms </b> – Research into the formation of innovation hubs has found that “anchor companies” <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/InnovationDistricts1.pdf">play a critical role</a>. Countless startups around the world have been founded by former employees of major companies like Microsoft, Intel and Google. These firms allow for critical skills and talent transfers into new localities but they also often provide mentorship and actively support the fostering of a robust start-up environment. Policy makers should understand that anchor companies provide a level of stability and experience that innovative startups can benefit from. <br><br>

<b>Moving beyond STEM in school</b> – According to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud hosting platform responsible for up to a third of the world’s internet traffic, there are currently more than 5,000 unfilled job openings in Australia requiring AWS certification while another 50,000 such job openings are expected in the next few years. There simply are not enough qualified technology workers in Australia to satisfy the demand for them.<br><br>

With the national digital technologies curriculum Australia now has the foundation in place for a future workforce with skills in computational thinking, data collection, interpretation and transformation, digital systems use and systems thinking. All Australian students from Year 3 onwards are now learning to write code. However there is a large existing workforce facing potential significant disruption over the next decade meaning governments and industry alike need to be thinking about and planning for worker retraining.<br><br>

<!--<b>Target strategic strengths</b> – As much as the United States has lessons for nations like Australia, there are still many areas where Australia cannot replicate anywhere close to the level of US success. A global outlook enables Australia to consider the innovation strategies of nations beyond the US, like Israel, Finland, or Taiwan. The governments of each of these countries were able to make <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/videos/innovation-and-the-state">targeted strategic investments</a> that successfully spurred high-tech growth.<br><br>-->

<!--While no government should be “picking winners”, it makes sense for Australia with limited human and financial capital to incentivize risk taking in specific sectors that look more promising for innovation than others. <br><br>-->
<!-- 
<b>Emphasize a culture of entrepreneurship </b>– As with all cultural change, a pro-innovation culture will take time to become normal for Australia. Political and business leaders and public commentators have an opportunity to shift the narrative to both the benefit of entrepreneurship and the risk of not pursuing innovation. Entrepreneurial success needs celebrating and failure needs to be recognized for the learning opportunity it presents. Think of the parallel of cooking – would you put your dinner party in the hands of someone who has never made a soufflé before, or a chef who has had her share of deflated attempts and learned the art of getting the oven temperature and timing just right? The answer is obvious, and yet in business in Australia we fear failure rather than see it as the opportunity to master something.
<br><br> -->

<b>Increase overseas awareness of Australia’s innovative capabilities</b> - There is little awareness of Australia’s innovative capabilities in regions in the United States that are always looking for more innovative talent, such as Silicon Valley, Boston, and New York.
This lack of awareness could be ameliorated with a public campaign by the Australian government in these regions that highlights Australia’s many strengths, such as less expensive engineers by an R&D tax credit –  world-leading tech adoption rate, and strong universities. These innovative capabilities, when combined with the fact that Australia is one of the most livable countries in the world, with public health care, affordable yet highly-ranked universities, and great weather – would surely help to draw the sort of innovative talent that Australia is looking to attract. <br><br>

<h1 id="FAQ" style="margin:0 auto"> FAQ and Methodology</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<b>What is innovation?</b><br><br>
Innovation is <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oslo-manual_9789264013100-en">defined by the OECD</a> as “the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), process, new marketing method or a new organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations.” Broadly, innovation enables doing things differently as well as doing different things. It turns ideas into opportunity.
<br><br>
<b>Why is innovation important?</b> <br><br>
Innovation drives business competitiveness, new business growth, new jobs and is a key driver of economic growth. Innovative economies are better able to support higher living standards and therefore innovation plays a key role in national prosperity. The OECD <a href="http://www.oecd.org/publications/the-innovation-imperative-9789264239814-en.htm">attributes</a> approximately 50 percent of member countries long term economic growth to innovation.
<br><br>
In terms of its relevance to Australia, innovation will determine the country’s future. Facing over a quarter century of continued economic growth following deregulation in the 1980’s and 1990’s and a mining boom through much of the 2000’s and 2010’s, Australia now enjoys high wage standards and standards of living as well as a strong social safety net. In order to maintain its lifestyle, however, Australia must find ways to innovate.
<br><br>
<b>What is the Global Innovation Index (GII) and why should we use it?</b><br><br>
Produced jointly by Cornell University, INSEAD business school and the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the Global Innovation Index assesses the innovation performance of 127 countries and economies around the world based on 81 indicators. It is the most authoritative and comprehensive resource for quantifying innovation amongst nations. It also clearly articulates what Australia does well and what Australia could do better in when it comes to innovation. <br><br>

There has been quite a debate in Australia and elsewhere about how precise the GII is. How exactly, <a href="http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/why-smashed-avocado-is-innovation-that-counts-20170919-gykbq4">some have asked</a>, can one quantify the impact of Australia’s popularization of avocado on toast? Cafes all over the world have now adopted the healthy Australian snack that innovated a new way to use an avocado but how is it quantified in the GII measurements? Avocado on toast is not quantified in the GII but neither is Japanese sushi or Korean Bibimbap or Scotland’s deep fried Mars bars. Ultimately, more comprehensive innovation measures should be sought but even then, it would be unlikely that improved measures would show that Australia innovates more than the other countries ranked higher than it on the GII.<br><br>

<b>Why compare Australia and America?</b><br><br>
The United States may be ranked as the fourth most innovative country in the world, but it remains the number one destination for the output of Australia’s innovation – and much of the world’s, for that matter. The obituary for the loss of America’s innovative supremacy has been written many times but this data, along with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/news-releases/new-cfr-book-how-american-innovation-can-overcome-asian-challenge">other research</a>, make it clear that such sentiment is still premature. Though many have proclaimed this to be the Asian Century, the United States still attracts the best and brightest minds for innovation, particularly from Australia. <br><br>

Furthermore, as a close ally in economic, military, intelligence, and diplomatic spheres, it only makes sense to analyse the differences in order to see what Australia does well compared to the United States and what Australia could perhaps learn from the United States.<br><br>

<b>What does innovation actually look like?</b><br><br>
There are four broad categories of innovation:<br><br>

<b>Product innovation</b> – the introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components, materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics. <br>
Example = the original iPhone.<br><br>

<b>Process innovation</b> – the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software.
Example: Moving from manual spreadsheet business accounts management to cloud-based accounting software like Xero.<br><br>

<b>Marketing innovation</b> – the implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing.
Example: introduction of bundling for Telcos in the 2000’s or product placement in tv shows, like Masterchef.<br><br>

<b>Organisational innovation </b> – the implementation of a new organisational method in the businesses business practices, workplace organisation or external relations.
Example: a restructure that changes the organisational structure from product silos to customer segments, or to a matrix organisation.


<h3>Methodology</h3>
The data in this report comes from the Global Innovation Index. The data was processed in R. All data visualizations were created in D3.js. All code used to create the data visualizations can be found on the USSC's <a href="https://github.com/USStudiesCentre/global-innovation-index">GitHub</a> page. This report has been produced using data from the Global Innovation Index [2010 to 2017].
